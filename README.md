## 🐧 About the Project

      Hello, I'm <strong>Pengin</strong> from <a href="https://gameindustry.eu">GameIndustry.eu</a>.<br>
      For several years, I’ve been working independently to analyze software behavior, identify links between products and companies and help users regain privacy and security.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

As part of this, I create structured filter lists and maintain a project website since 2017.  
It offers information on companies, software mechanics, privacy tools, reviews and more.

My goal is to give people insight into what their software does — which services are contacted, what data is transmitted and to whom.  
With various forms of presentation and data examples, I aim to make this transparent and understandable.

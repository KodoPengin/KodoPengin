      Hello, I'm <strong>Pengin</strong> from <a href="https://gameindustry.eu">GameIndustry.eu</a>.  
      For several years, I’ve been working independently and idealistically to analyze software behavior, identify links between products and companies, and help users around the world regain some privacy and security.

      As part of this, I create structured filter lists based on product names and identifiers.  
      Since 2017, I’ve also been maintaining a project website that provides background information on companies, mechanics, software analyses, game reviews, tools, and more.

      The aim is to give people insight into what their software does, which services are contacted, what data is transmitted — and to whom. To make this transparent and understandable,  I use different forms of presentation.
      I hope to contribute, in a small way, to a safer digital world — especially for the people using it.
